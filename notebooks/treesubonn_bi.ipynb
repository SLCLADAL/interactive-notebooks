Despite these obvious advantages, they have at least one major short coming compared to other, more sophisticated tree-structure models (in addition to the general issues that tree-structure models exhibit as discussed above: they are prone to **overfitting** which means that they fit the observed data very well but preform much worse when being applied to new data.\n",
