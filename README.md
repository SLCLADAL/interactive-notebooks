This repository holds a series of interactive notebooks to be run on any Binder instance. Click the link above to launch a live instance with everything you need to run these already installed.


## Contributing

TODO: expand on the following:

- installing dependencies via install.R as that is significantly faster 
in the particular way binderhub creates the repo
- recommend a way to show installing packages in a notebook but not run normally
- linting and tests:
    - We can test notebooks by ensuring that they at least run end to end
    - We should come to some kind of conclusions about showing versions as run
      for Jupyter notebooks - it might be useful to have notebooks launch in the
      not run state.
